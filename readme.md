# I have an problem in git branches.

```sh
git commit -m first commit
git status  (on master branch)
```

Then when I perform ` git branch -a` and ` git checkout master`.(I get an error in git checkout master).

**Therefore, I create a new branch called main.**

**I want to know why the master branch is lost after the git branch -a and git checkout master give me an error.**
